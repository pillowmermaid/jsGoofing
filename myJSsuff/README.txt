These are a few simple javascript exercises.

They're based on this set of exercises: http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/kurser/webtechnology/lab4.html

I had to go through and change some function names from the ones asked for in the list because the function names they suggest
using are already functions within JavaScript.

The descriptions given to the user are bit ambiguous as to what the undlying functions actually do, hence this linking the original page
for full and proper descriptions. Each of the functions are displayed in order of question.
